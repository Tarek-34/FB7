# Python Programming Projects

This repository contains six interactive Python programs that demonstrate key concepts such as random number generation, user input handling, class definitions, and more. Below is an overview of each program with instructions on how to use them.

## 1. **Lottery Number Generator (PowerBall)**
### Description:
This program generates random numbers for a PowerBall ticket. It selects 5 white ball numbers (1-69) and 1 red ball number (1-26).

### Instructions:
- Run the program to print a PowerBall ticket with random numbers.
- The output displays five numbers separated by spaces, and the red ball number with three spaces before it.

## 2. **Number Guessing Game**
### Description:
A fun guessing game where the computer picks a secret number between 1 and 10. The player keeps guessing until they get it right, with hints on whether their guess is too high or too low.

### Instructions:
- Run the program.
- Input your guesses until you guess correctly.
- Optionally quit the game by following prompts.

## 3. **Trivia Quiz Game**
### Description:
This program quizzes the player with trivia questions. It uses a dictionary to store questions and answers and gives feedback on whether the player’s answers are correct.

### Instructions:
- Run the program to start the quiz.
- Answer each question; the program provides immediate feedback.
- Continue until all questions are answered.

## 4. **Text Color Formatter**
### Description:
This program contains five functions to display text in different colors using ANSI escape codes. The user can input a string and choose which color to apply.

### Instructions:
- Run the program and input the text to be colored.
- Select the color for your text from the provided options.
- Optionally, use the random color function to pick a color at random.

## 5. **Bank Account Management System**
### Description:
This program simulates a simple banking system. Users can deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of a single bank account through an interactive menu.

### Instructions:
- Enter your account number to verify access.
- Use the menu options to deposit, withdraw, or check your balance.
- Exit the system when done.

## 6. **Bank Account Class Implementation**
### Description:
This program defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. It demonstrates the use of class objects and loops for interactive sessions.

### Instructions:
- Run the program and enter your account number.
- Choose actions from the menu to manage your balance.
- Exit the system when you’re finished.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x).
2. Save each program as a `.py` file in your desired directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the program files are located.
5. Run each program using the command:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

## Optional Features (Implemented Across Programs)
- **Random Number Generation**: Demonstrated in the Lottery and Guessing Game programs.
- **Loops and Conditional Logic**: Utilized throughout to ensure continuous interaction until the user decides to quit.
- **Class Definitions**: Seen in the Bank Account Management System programs.
